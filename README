This folder will be used when testing whether we can commit and whatnot. All stuff here is useless.

Here is how to add and commit stuff in a working folder:

**************************************************************************
git add <file_name>
git commit -m 'Descriptive text of what was changed, modified, added, etc.'
git push -u origin master
**************************************************************************

to create a working directory to send stuff from refer to the Github "Create A Repo" guide
